You are the owner of a courier company and want to make a system for tracking your cars and their cargo. 

Define a class Car that holds information about model, engine, cargo and a collection of exactly 4 tires. 

The engine, cargo and tire should be separate classes, create a constructor that receives all information 
about the Car and creates and initializes its inner components (engine, cargo and tires).

On the first line of input you will receive a number N - the amount of cars you have, 
on each of the next N lines you will receive information about a car in the format 
“
<Model> 
<EngineSpeed> <EnginePower> 
<CargoWeight> <CargoType> 
<Tire1Pressure> <Tire1Age> <Tire2Pressure> <Tire2Age> <Tire3Pressure> <Tire3Age> <Tire4Pressure> <Tire4Age>
” 
where the speed, power, weight and tire age are integers, tire pressure is a double. 

After the N lines you will receive a single line with one of 2 commands “fragile” or “flamable” , 

if the command is “fragile” print all cars whose Cargo Type is “fragile” with a tire whose pressure is  < 1, 

if the command is “flamable” print all cars whose Cargo Type is “flamable” and have Engine Power > 250. 

The cars should be printed in order of appearing in the input.
